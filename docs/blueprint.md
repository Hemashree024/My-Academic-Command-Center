## Core Features:

- Task Entry: Allows users to add tasks with descriptions and due dates. Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage.
- Task Display: Display tasks in a clear, organized list, sorted by due date. Each task shows its description and due date. Include filtering by tags.
- Task Management: Enable users to mark tasks as complete, which moves them to a separate 'Completed' section. Allow users to edit or delete tasks.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calm blue (#3498db) for focus and clarity.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#ecf0f1) for backgrounds and subtle elements.
- Accent: Green (#2ecc71) to indicate task completion and success.
- Clean, card-based layout for tasks to provide a clear visual structure.
- Use simple, recognizable icons for task actions (e.g., edit, delete, complete).
- Subtle animations for task transitions (e.g., marking as complete) to provide visual feedback.
